# AI-Voice-Caller
 create an AI voice calling application similar to Vapi or Retellai. The ideal candidate should have experience in voice recognition, natural language processing, and telecommunication APIs. The goal is to develop a seamless and user-friendly interface for voice interactions. This application should also include a built-in calendar similar to cal.com or Calendly 
==========
Creating an AI voice calling application similar to VAPI or RetellAI, which involves voice recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and telecommunication APIs, is a multi-faceted project. It would require integration of various components, including AI models for voice recognition and synthesis, a telephony API for voice calls, and a calendar API for scheduling purposes.
Project Overview

    Voice Recognition: This will enable the application to recognize user speech.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): This will process and understand the recognized speech and generate intelligent responses.
    Telecommunication API: A service like Twilio or VAPI will handle voice call interactions.
    Calendar Integration: The system will include a built-in calendar (similar to cal.com or Calendly) for scheduling appointments.

Key Components

    Voice Recognition: Use a library like Google Speech-to-Text or Whisper AI for converting speech to text.
    Text-to-Speech (TTS): Use a service like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or 11 Labs for generating voice responses from text.
    Telecommunication API: Use Twilio or VAPI to make voice calls.
    Calendar API: Use Google Calendar API or a similar service for scheduling appointments.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x for back-end development.
    Twilio API for voice calling and handling phone numbers.
    Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for voice recognition.
    Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for text-to-speech conversion.
    Google Calendar API for calendar integration.

Setup

    Install Dependencies:

    pip install twilio google-cloud-speech google-cloud-texttospeech google-auth google-api-python-client flask

    Sign up for services:
        Twilio: Sign up for a Twilio account and get API keys.
        Google Cloud: Sign up for Google Cloud and enable Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Google Calendar API.

    Setup Credentials:
        Store your Twilio and Google Cloud credentials securely.

Step-by-Step Code Implementation
Step 1: Setting up the Flask API for Handling Voice Calls

Flask will be used to create the web application where the voice interaction and calendar scheduling will occur.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from twilio.rest import Client
from google.cloud import speech
from google.cloud import texttospeech
import os
import json

# Set up Google Cloud credentials for Speech and Text-to-Speech APIs
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path/to/google/credentials.json"

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

# Flask app setup
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize Twilio Client
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Initialize Google Cloud Speech Client
speech_client = speech.SpeechClient()

# Initialize Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Client
text_to_speech_client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()

@app.route('/start_call', methods=['POST'])
def start_call():
    to_phone_number = request.json['to_phone_number']
    
    call = twilio_client.calls.create(
        to=to_phone_number,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        url="http://your-flask-server-url/voice_interaction"
    )

    return jsonify({"message": "Call started", "call_sid": call.sid})


@app.route('/voice_interaction', methods=['POST'])
def voice_interaction():
    """Handle the interactive voice response using Google Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech."""
    # Get the audio recording from the call
    recording_url = request.values.get("RecordingUrl")
    
    # Download the recording and transcribe it using Google Speech-to-Text
    audio_content = download_audio(recording_url)
    transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_content)
    
    # Process transcription and generate response
    response_text = process_transcription(transcription)
    
    # Convert response text to speech
    audio_response = text_to_speech(response_text)
    
    return audio_response


def download_audio(url):
    """Download the recorded audio."""
    # In practice, this would download the file and return its content.
    return b"audio content"  # Mocked for simplicity


def transcribe_audio(audio_content):
    """Convert audio content to text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text."""
    audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=audio_content)
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code="en-US",
    )

    response = speech_client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)
    transcription = response.results[0].alternatives[0].transcript
    return transcription


def text_to_speech(response_text):
    """Convert text to speech using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API."""
    synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=response_text)
    voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
        language_code="en-US", ssml_gender=texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender.NEUTRAL
    )
    audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(
        audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3
    )

    # Generate speech from text
    response = text_to_speech_client.synthesize_speech(
        input=synthesis_input, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config
    )

    return response.audio_content


def process_transcription(transcription):
    """Process the transcription and generate an appropriate response."""
    # Example: If the transcription contains certain keywords, trigger calendar scheduling
    if "schedule" in transcription:
        return "Sure, I can help you schedule an appointment. Please tell me the date and time."
    else:
        return "I didn't understand. Could you please repeat that?"

@app.route('/schedule_event', methods=['POST'])
def schedule_event():
    """Handle event scheduling using Google Calendar API."""
    # Get event details from request
    event_data = request.json
    
    # Set up the event details
    event = {
        "summary": event_data['title'],
        "description": event_data['description'],
        "start": {
            "dateTime": event_data['start_datetime'],
            "timeZone": 'America/New_York',
        },
        "end": {
            "dateTime": event_data['end_datetime'],
            "timeZone": 'America/New_York',
        },
    }

    # Add the event to Google Calendar (use Google Calendar API)
    # Note: This part assumes you have Google API set up for Calendar integration

    return jsonify({"message": "Event scheduled successfully"})


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Code

    Flask API: The Flask app handles API requests, including starting calls, handling voice interactions, and scheduling events.
    Twilio Integration: The app uses Twilio's API to start calls and handle voice interactions. The URL for the call (voice_interaction) is where it handles transcriptions and speech generation.
    Voice Interaction:
        Speech-to-Text: The audio is transcribed into text using Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text API.
        Text-to-Speech: The response text is converted to speech using Google Cloud’s Text-to-Speech API.
    Calendar Scheduling: The /schedule_event endpoint integrates Google Calendar API to schedule events.

Future Enhancements

    Security and Authentication: Implement proper authentication and access controls.
    Improved NLP: Use NLP models to process more complex user requests and interactions.
    Real-time Feedback: Enhance the system to handle multi-turn conversations.
    Cloud Deployment: Consider deploying on a secure cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).

This approach should give you a solid foundation for building a voice-interactive application with features like voice calls, transcription, text-to-speech, and calendar integration.
